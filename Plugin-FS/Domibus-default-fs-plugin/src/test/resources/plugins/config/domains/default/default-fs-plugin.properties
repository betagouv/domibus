# Available properties for the FS Plugin

#
# Workers Scheduling
# These properties define the FS Plugin workers scheduling.
#

# The time interval (in milliseconds) used to poll the sending filesystem for new files.
# E.g.: 10000
#default.fsplugin.messages.send.worker.repeatInterval=10000

# The delay (in milliseconds) to allow the writing process to finish writing.
# E.g.: 2000
default.fsplugin.messages.send.delay=2000

# The cron expression used to trigger the worker to purge the sent files that were archived.
# E.g.: 0 0/1 * * * ?
default.fsplugin.messages.sent.purge.worker.cronExpression=0 0/1 * * * ?

# The cron expression used to trigger the worker to purge the failed files that were archived.
# E.g.: 0 0/1 * * * ?
default.fsplugin.messages.failed.purge.worker.cronExpression=0 0/1 * * * ?

# The cron expression used to trigger the worker to purge the received files.
# E.g.: 0 0/1 * * * ?
default.fsplugin.messages.received.purge.worker.cronExpression=0 0/1 * * * ?

# The cron expression used to trigger the worker to purge the orphan lock files.
default.fsplugin.messages.locks.purge.worker.cronExpression=0 0 0/1 * * ?

#The threshold value in MB to switch from synchronous to asynchronous saving of payloads

#
# General properties
# The general properties can be overridden per domain.
#

# Regarding the "default.fsplugin.messages.location" property, the FS Plugin supports multiple file system types via Apache VFS.
# There are 4 file systems currently supported:
#
# * Local: A local file system is simply a directory on the local physical system. The URI format is:
#   [file://]absolute-path Where absolute-path is a valid absolute file name for the local platform. UNC names are
#   supported under Windows.This type of file system does not support authentication.
#   E.g.: file:///home/someuser/somedir
#         file:///C:/Documents and Settings
#
# * SMB/CIFS: A SMB/CIFS file system is a remote directory shared via Samba or Windows Share, with the following URI
#   format: smb://hostname[:port]/sharename[/relative-path]. Notice that a share name is mandatory.
#   E.g.: smb://somehost/shareA
#         smb://somehost/shareB/nesteddir
#
# * SFTP: An SFTP file system is a remote directory shared via SFTP. Uses an URI of the following format:
#   sftp://hostname[:port][/relative-path]. The path is relative to whatever path the server has configured as base
#   directory, usually the user's home directory.
#   E.g.: smb://somehost/shareA
#         smb://somehost/shareB/nesteddir
#
# * FTP: An FTP file system is a remote directory shared via FTP. Accepts URIs of the following format:
#   ftp://hostname[:port][/relative-path]. The path is relative to whatever path the server has configured as base
#   directory, usually the user's home directory.
#   E.g.: ftp://somelinuxhost/home/someuser/pub/downloads/

# The location of the folder that the plugin will use to manage the messages to be sent and received in case no domain
# expression matches. This location must be accessible to the Domibus instance.
# E.g.: /home/domibus/fs_plugin_data/MAIN
default.fsplugin.messages.location=/tmp/fs_plugin_data

# The file action executed when the file is successfully sent: 'delete' to permanently remove the file or 'archive' to
# move it into the SENT folder.
# E.g.: delete
default.fsplugin.messages.sent.action=delete

# The expiration limit (expressed in seconds) used to purge the older files in the SENT folder.
# E.g.: 600
#default.fsplugin.messages.sent.purge.expired=600

# The file action executed when the file is fails to send: 'delete' to permanently remove the file or 'archive' to move
# it into the FAILED folder.
# E.g.: delete
default.fsplugin.messages.failed.action=archive

# The expiration limit (expressed in seconds) used to purge the older files in the FAILED folder
# E.g.: 600
default.fsplugin.messages.failed.purge.expired=

# The expiration limit (expressed in seconds) used to purge the older orphaned lock files;0 to disable
default.fsplugin.messages.locks.purge.expired=

# The expiration limit (expressed in seconds) used to purge the older files in the IN folder.
# E.g.: 600
#default.fsplugin.messages.received.purge.expired=600

# The payload identifier for messages processed on the default domain.
#default.fsplugin.messages.payload.id=cid:message

#Queues
#This queue is used by the plugin to send the files in parallel
default.fsplugin.send.queue=domibus.fsplugin.send.queue

# Specify concurrency limits via a "lower-upper" String, e.g. "5-10", or a simple upper limit String, e.g. "10" (the lower limit will be 1 in this case)
# when sending files
#default.fsplugin.send.queue.concurrency=5-20
