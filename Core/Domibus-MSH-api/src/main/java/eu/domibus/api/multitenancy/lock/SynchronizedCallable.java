/**
 * Wrapper for the Runnable class to be executed. Attempts to lock via db record and in case it succeeds it runs the wrapped Runnable.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Only use with tasks that are short in duration since the locking requires an active database transaction
 *
 * If using the SynchronizationServiceImpl as synchronizationService then the synchronization will be done using a pessimistic lock,
 * so a transaction has to be active to acquire the lock initially and has to end only after the runnable task has finished.
 * Instantiate using SynchronizedRunnableFactory, so it can be managed by Spring which needs to start the transaction required by the run method.
 * Note that Spring transactions are thread specific so any exceptions on this thread will not roll back the transaction of the parent thread.
 * See eu.domibus.core.SynchronizedRunnableIT for detailed behaviour in case of exceptions.
